"Better description of a relationship Is there a better way to decide which of two lines provides a better description of a relationship (rather than just
comparing the predicted value to the actual value for one data point in the sample)? <|endoftext|>"
Residuals One way to think about how useful a line is for describing a relationship between two variables is to use the line to predict the y-values for the points in the scatter plot. <|endoftext|>
"What is the sum of the residuals a.For the line 𝑦 = 25.3 + 3.66𝑥, calculate the missing values, and add them to complete the table b.Why is the residual in the table’s first row positive and the residual in the second row negative?  c.What is the sum of the residuals? Why did you get a number close to zero for this sum? Does this mean that all ofthe residuals were close to 𝟎? <|endoftext|>"
"The fit of the line to the data When you use a line to describe the relationship between two numerical variables, the best line is the line that makes theresiduals as small as possible overall. If the residuals tend to be small, what does that say about the fit of the line to the data?    <|endoftext|>"
Calculate the square of each residual and place The most common choice for the best line is the line that makes the sum of the squared residuals as small as possible.Add a column on the right of the table. Calculate the square of each residual and place the answer in thecolumn. a.Why do we use the sum of the squared residuals instead of just the sum of the residuals (without squaring)?Hint: Think about whether the sum of the residuals for a line can be small even if the prediction errors are large.Can this happen for squared residuals? b.What is the sum of the squared residuals for the line 𝒚 = 𝟐𝟓. 𝟑 + 𝟑. 𝟔𝟔𝒙 and the data ? <|endoftext|>
The Least Squares Line (Best-Fit Line) The line that has a smaller sum of squared residuals than any other line is called the least squares line. <|endoftext|>
"Enter the shoe-length and height data Enter the shoe-length and height data, and then use your calculator to find the equation of the least squares line.

"What height would you predict for a man Assuming that the 10 men in the sample are representative of adult men in general, what height would you predict
for a man whose shoe length is 12.5 in.? What height would you predict for a man whose shoe length is 11.9 in.? <|endoftext|>"
"Slope of the least squares line Once you have found the equation of the least squares line, the values of the slope and 𝒚-intercept of the line oftenreveal something interesting about the relationship you are modeling.The slope of the least squares line is the change in the predicted value of the 𝒚-variable associated with an increase ofone in the value of the 𝒙-variable. Give an interpretation of the slope of the least squares line 𝒚 = 𝟐𝟓. 𝟑 + 𝟑. 𝟔𝟔𝒙 for predicting height from shoe sizefor adult men. <|endoftext|>"
"Explain why it does not make sense to interpret The 𝒚-intercept of a line is the predicted value of 𝒚 when 𝒙 equals zero.

The difference betweenthe medians of the two halves is called the interquartile range, or IQR.   a. What is the IQR for each of the three restaurants?  b. Which of the restaurants had the smallest IQR, and what does that tell you?   c. The median of the bottom half of the data is called the lower quartile (denoted by Q1), and the median of thetop half of the data is called the upper quartile (denoted by Q3). About what fraction of the data would bebetween the lower and upper quartiles? Explain your thinking. <|endoftext|>"

"Consider the following summaries An advertising agency researched the ages of viewers most interested in various types of television ads. Consider thefollowing summaries: a. The mean age of the people surveyed is approximately 𝟓𝟎 years old. As a result, the producers of the show decidedto obtain advertisers for a typical viewer of 𝟓𝟎 years old. According to the table, what products or services do youthink the producers will target? Based on the sample, what percent of the people surveyed about the Fact or Fictionshow would have been interested in these commercials if the advertising table is accurate? b. The show failed to generate the interest the advertisers hoped. As a result, they stopped advertising on the show,and the show was cancelled. Kristin made the argument that a better age to describe the typical viewer is themedian age. What is the median age of the sample? What products or services does the advertising table suggestfor viewers if the median age is considered as a description of the typical viewer? c. What percent of the people surveyed would be interested in the products or services suggested by the advertisingtable if the median age were used to describe a typical viewer? d. What percent of the viewers have ages between Q1 and Q3? The difference between Q3 and Q1, or Q3 – Q1, iscalled the interquartile range, or IQR. What is the IQR for this data distribution? e. The IQR provides a summary of the variability for a skewed data distribution. The IQR is a number that specifies thelength of the interval that contains the middle half of the ages of viewers.

All the data were taken on thesame evening at the same time.  The outside temperature 𝑇, in degrees Fahrenheit, can be predicted by using two different formulas.

What value of 𝑇 is being predicted by the crickets?  b.  For katydids, 𝑇 is predicted by adding 161 to the mean number of chirps per minute and then dividing the sum by 3. What value of 𝑇 is being predicted by the katydids?  c.  The temperature was 75 degrees Fahrenheit when these data were recorded, so using the mean from each data set gave an accurate prediction of temperature.
